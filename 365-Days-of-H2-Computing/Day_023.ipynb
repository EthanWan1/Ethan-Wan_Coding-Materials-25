    "A local variable is a variable that is only accessible within the routine in which it is declared, whereas a global variable is a variable that is accessible from all parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good programming practice to avoid the use of global variables. Variables that are only used within a routine should be declared as local variables within the routine. Values that are required by several routines should be passed as parameters. By doing so, we help to ensure that any defined routines are fully modular, and do not require the specification of any global variables outside the routine in question.\n",
