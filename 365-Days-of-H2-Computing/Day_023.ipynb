    "It is good programming practice to avoid the use of global variables. Variables that are only used within a routine should be declared as local variables within the routine. Values that are required by several routines should be passed as parameters.

    "1. **call frames** (also **activation records**), an area of memory that is set aside to keep track of a function call in progress. Each function call creates a call frame and when the function returns, the call frame is removed from the memory. Each call frame contains the name of the function that was called, and \"where to pick up from\" when the function call returns.\n",
    "2. storage for local variables.\n",
