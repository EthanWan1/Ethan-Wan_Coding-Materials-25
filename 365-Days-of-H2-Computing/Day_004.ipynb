    "## D4.1 Programming Constructs : Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The last programming construct is the iteration construct, which allows us to specify loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we will notice that our code requires the execution of similar repeated steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iteration, or loop construct allows us to automate repeated steps. More specifically, iteration is the act of repeating a process to achieve a specific end goal. When iteration is used, the sequence/set of instructions within the loop will keep repeating until a certain condition/requirement has been reached, or is no longer satisfied. Each repetition is also known as an iteration. The results of one iteration are used as the starting point for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration usually involves the use of loops. Most commonly used loops include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For** loops : Loops with an explicit counter for every iteration. This allows the body of the `for` loop code to know about the sequencing (i.e. index number) of the iteration. \n",
    "2. **While-Do** loops : Loops which continually execute a statement while a particular expression (of a condition/set of conditions) is true. It is executed zero or more times. \n",
    "3. **Do-While** (or Repeat-Until) loops : Similar to while-do loops, except the expression is evaluated at the end. Hence, the block of code is executed at once, then only repeats when the specified condition or set of conditions is met. (Not in Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `for` and `while` loops follow the structure below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">```python\n",
    ">for index in <iterable>:\n",
    ">    <action_here>\n",
    ">\n",
    ">while <condition>:\n",

By default, `step = 1`.\n",
