    "In order to ensure that any code we write will function correctly under all possible circumstances, we must employ testing. This is especially pertinent to logic and arithmetic errors, but is also applicable to static semantic errors (though it typically has no bearing on syntax errors since testing for that is handled by the interpreter/compiler).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that the program under scrutiny functions as intended, appropriate test cases must be specified. Test cases fall into 3 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normal (valid) cases. Normal data values correspond to data that would normally be input into the program. With such test cases, the program should accept the test case, process it, and output a result that is checked to ensure that it is the same as the expected result.\n",
    "- Boundary (extreme) cases. Boundary data values correspond to values that are chosen to be the absolute limits of the normal range. Extreme values are used in testing to make sure that all normal values will be accepted and processed correctly.\n",
    "- Abnormal (erroneous) cases. Abnormal data values correspond to values that should not normally be accepted by the system - the values are invalid. The program should reject any abnormal values. Abnormal values are used in testing to ensure that invalid data does not cause a runtime error.\n",

    "It should be noted that testing encompasses a more complex framework for larger projects that involve many programmers. For the purposes of these notes, we will restrict testing to individual algorithms and smaller snippets of code.\n"
